# VirtQueue
Making Physical Queueing Virtual

# How Does VirtQueue work?

1. You deploy it with a hosting provider of your choice.

2. Add the customer to your VirtQueue. They are notified by SMS/Web of the progress of the order.

3. You control when people are ready to visit and help reduce foot fall while providing customer forfillment!
